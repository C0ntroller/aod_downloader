# Anime on Demand Downloader
This simple python program uses a web scraper to download videos from the German site [Anime on Demand](https://www.anime-on-demand.de/).
I did this because there is [another solution](https://github.com/BreakingBread0/AnimeOnDemand-Downloader) (which is basicly the same) but it's Windows only and stores the credentials in plaintext. Also it doesn't work for movies.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* robobrowser
* [this fix for robobrowser as it's currently broken](https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser/pull/94/files)

## Usage
Currently it's cli only and should be self-explanatory (well, if you are German atleast). You **can** store your password (just edit the py file) but theres no encryption.

## Liability
AFAIK this tool could easily be detected. Use at your own risk. Don't blame me for banned accounts etc.
